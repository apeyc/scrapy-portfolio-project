# scrapy-portfolio-project

This was my first time using Scrapy, with this code I am showcasing my problem solving skills. 
My biggest issue was figuring out how to use the next_page command to scrape the following product pages. 
While nothing I tried worked properly, I realized if  the following page URLs are added to start_urls at 
the beginning of the code it would perform the same action instead of using the next_page functionality.
